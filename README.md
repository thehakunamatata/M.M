- 👋 Hi, I’m M.M, from Wareville Town.
- 👀 I’m interested in ensuring that SOC-mas does not happen this year and will do all I can to sabotage it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop tools to sabotage and monitor the citizens of Wareville. One thing is to find someone to blame for all this. Maybe Glitch will take the blame.
- 📫 How to reach me? Find me around Wareville.
